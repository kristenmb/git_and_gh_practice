New Zealand will always be one of my favorite travel destinations. Gorgeous scenery, unbelievably kind people, and so many options for activities. Mountains, beaches, cities. New Zealand's got it all.
I also love visiting Taos, New Mexico. My friend is building a house on the mesa in Taos, and we often visit her land to work on the house or spend some time away from the city. Its quiet and calm, and a little wild. A great breath of fresh air.
I am excited to be able to travel again one day, and I hope to visit more of Europe, spend some time in Africa, and make my way through SE Asia. There is so much I want to see and experience. I can't wait!
