I enjoy listening to records on vinyl. Hearing an album in its entirety, as the artist intended it be heard is a unique and lovely way to experience an album.
I enjoy hosting dinner parties for friends, making food together and drinking good cocktails in the comfort of our homes.
I love to play music - I can play the piano, ukulele, guitar, and melodica. I enjoy singing with my sister and learning to play songs i love on my own.
Finding creative ways to spend time in nature is another favorite.
